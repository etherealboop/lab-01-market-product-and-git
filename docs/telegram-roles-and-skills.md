## Roles and responsibilities

- Programmer (Mobile) - Designs and builds the mobile app screens and features, integrating APIs, local storage, and device capabilities so users can register, receive SMS, and interact smoothly with the service. They also fix bugs, improve performance on different phones, and keep the app updated with OS changes.
- Backend programmer – Implements server‑side logic for the message handling and AUTH & Session services, including APIs, database models, and message routing workflows. They ensure secure data processing, authorization checks, and performance/scalability under high traffic.
- QA (Quality Assurance) – Plans and executes manual and automated tests across the mobile app and backend services to catch defects before release. They verify that requirements are met, regressions are avoided, and edge cases (failed SMS, expired sessions, etc.) behave correctly.
- Cybersec engineer – Focuses on securing the AUTH & Session and message handling services by doing threat modeling, vulnerability assessments, and code reviews with a security lens. They define and enforce encryption, authentication, and authorization practices, monitor for attacks, and ensure compliance with relevant security standards.
- Volunteers (3rd party bot services) – Configure and operate chatbots or support flows that interact with users via external platforms, making sure messages are correctly formatted and routed into your system. They also report issues, help refine conversation scripts, and coordinate with developers when integrations break or new scenarios are needed.
